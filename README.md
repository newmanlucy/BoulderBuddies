# Boulder Buddies
Tech Together Boston 2021

Developers: Lucille (Lucy) Newman, Taniya Shaffer

## How to Use
Currently, Boulder Buddies sits on a Google Cloud Platform handled by Django. We are currently in the process of getting the front-end React web app onto the remote host as well. In the meantime, this project works like any other in a local development environment. There are 4 main "pages": 'home', 'register', 'login', and 'messaging'. In order to access the home page, you must register if you don't have an account or login if you do. 

## Inspiration
As an athletic female, it is difficult to find like-minded friends who just want to vibe and do physical activities. So, we thought, what better way to meet new people who share an interest in climbing but strictly for women and LGBTQ+?

## What it does
Boulder Buddies is a web application for women and LGBTQ+ people to register their location with a simple name and biography with V grade climbing level to match skill with other people in the area. 

## How we built it
We built it using ~~our tears and laughter~~: _HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React, Django, Google Cloud Platform, Google Maps API, @material-ui/core API on Visual Studio Code_

## Challenges we ran into
Definitely many! A lot of bugs. One of the major design issues we ran into was putting the climber cards (users) aligned next to the map. We fixed many of our alignment issues using the @material-ui/core library and even found some more efficient ways of programming other features that previously gave problems. Such as the hover over text tooltip, and scrollable grid for cards on the home page. Something that took up a chunk of time was passing the information from the front-end to the back-end via REST APIs and Bootstrap.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
#"ACTUALLY FINISHING THIS THING!!"

But really, getting to legit learn some web development. It's been a frustrating 36 hours filled with eureka moments like figuring out which ```<div>``` tag to add a CSS styling header to... 

## What we learned
This prototype of Boulder Buddies is definitely a huge step in the right direction for a web application that we want to see on the Internet. We learned how to utilize Django and set up a database on Google Cloud Platform. We learned how to connect it to a React front-end. We learned the frustrations of HTML5 and CSS. Most importantly we learned that sometimes the best way to find a community is to create one!

## What's next for Boulder Buddies
